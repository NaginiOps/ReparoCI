**‚ú® The Mending Charm for your CI/CD. An open-source AI agent that automatically debugs failed pipelines and delivers the analysis right to your pull request.**

> Hey everyone! We're two developers who have spent a few years building software at various places. Like you, we've wasted countless hours trying to fix broken CI/CD pipelines. We decided it was time to build a solution.
>
> ReparoCI is currently in the pre-launch phase. We're working hard to build the first version and would love for you to follow our journey.

## The Problem: The Ritual of the Red 'X'

You push your code, wait for the CI to run, and see the dreaded red 'X'. Now the real work begins. You navigate to the workflow run, find the failed job, open a new tab to start debugging, and begin the frustrating ritual of scrolling through thousands of lines of logs.

This manual, reactive process is a tax on developer productivity. **Debugging shouldn't be a separate, manual step you have to initiate; it should be an integrated part of the pipeline itself.**

## The Solution: A Proactive AI Agent, Not Another Chat Window

**ReparoCI is a fully automated agent that lives inside your CI/CD pipeline.** It's not a chat tool you have to manually open after a failure. When a pipeline fails, ReparoCI runs as a final step, automatically analyzes the context, and **proactively pushes a clear, helpful comment** to your pull request.

**No clicks, no chats, no context-switching‚Äîjust answers.**

The analysis will explain:
*   **üí¨ The Root Cause:** What *really* went wrong, in plain English.
*   **üí° The Suggested Fix:** An actionable code snippet or command to solve the problem.
*   **‚úÖ The Path Forward:** So you can get back to what you do best‚Äîbuilding.

Imagine pushing your code and finding the solution waiting for you, directly in the PR. That's the future we're building.

## üó∫Ô∏è Our Roadmap to a World-Class Tool

We are building in the open and are laser-focused on creating the best CI/CD debugging tool in the world. Our roadmap is ambitious and community-driven.

*   [ ] **Initial Release (v0.1):** Launch the initial open-source GitHub Action, built as a proactive agent that delivers high-quality analysis for common failures.
*   [ ] **One-Click Fixes (v0.2):** Introduce one click fix, allowing you to apply fixes with a single click directly from the PR comment.
*   [ ] **Deeper Diagnostic Capabilities (v0.3):** Relentlessly improve the assistant to handle tough errors, such as complex Docker build failures, cryptic compiler errors, and confusing dependency conflicts.
*   [ ] **Cross-Platform Intelligence (v1.0):** Bring the magic of ReparoCI to other platforms like **GitLab CI and Jenkins**, creating a single, consistent debugging experience for all developers, everywhere.

We are building this for you, and we need your help to make it great. You can view our public roadmap and contribute ideas [here](https://github.com/orgs/NaginiOps/projects/1).

## üëã Get Involved & Follow Our Journey

We are building ReparoCI in public and would love for you to be part of our community from day one.

*   **‚≠ê Star & Watch:** This is the best way to get notified when we launch our first version. Your star is also a huge vote of confidence for us!
*   **üó£Ô∏è Join the Discussion:** Have a question, a cool idea, or want to share your CI horror stories? The [**Discussions tab**](https://github.com/NaginiOps/ReparoCI/discussions) is the perfect place for open-ended conversation.
*   **üìù Suggest a Feature:** Have a specific feature request? Open an [**Issue**](https://github.com/NaginiOps/ReparoCI/issues). Think of it as our public backlog.

We can't wait to share what we're building with you.

*P.S. We're focused on writing the code for ReparoCI, so we used an AI assistant to help us craft this README. We think it's a pretty good use of AI to help developers focus on what matters most‚Äîjust like our product aims to do.*
